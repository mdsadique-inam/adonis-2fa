summary: How set Adonis-2FA Lucid Model
---

# Model

If you want to configure your `User` model to follow the basic flow that we recommend, this is the code:

```ts
// ...other imports
import encryption from '@adonisjs/core/services/encryption'
import { TwoFactorSecret } from '@mdsadique-inam/adonis-2fa/types'

export default class User extends compose(BaseModel, AuthFinder) {
  // ...other user columns

  // highlight-start
 @column({ consume: (value) => Boolean(value) })
  isTwoFactorEnabled: boolean = false
  // highlight-end

  // highlight-start
  @column({
    serializeAs: null,
    consume: (value: string) => (value ? encryption.decrypt(value) : null),
    prepare: (value: string) => encryption.encrypt(value),
  })
  declare twoFactorSecret: TwoFactorSecret | null
  // highlight-end

  // highlight-start
  @column({
    serializeAs: null,
    consume: (value: string) => (value ? encryption.decrypt(value) : []),
    prepare: (value: string[]) => encryption.encrypt(value),
  })
  declare twoFactorRecoveryCodes: string[]
  // highlight-end
}
```

- The `isTwoFactorEnabled` will be used to check if the user has enabled the 2FA or not. It is worth mentioning, that you `SHOULD NOT` set that to `true` until the user has verified the OTP at least one time, or they will be locked without being able to login in anymore.

- The `twoFactorSecret` is the user `Secret` generated by the lib. Should be encrypted as good practice.

- The `twoFactorRecoveryCodes` is the user `Recovery Codes` generated by the lib. Should be encrypted as good practice.
